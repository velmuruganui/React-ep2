### Components


* Reusable UI building blocks
* Components are like individual LEGO pieces (reusable building blocks)
* Each component is a function that returns JSX
* Components are in separate files for better organization 
* Components start with capital letters (Greeting, UserCard)
* Can be nested inside other components


### Props

* Way to pass data from parent to child components
* Read-only (can't be modified by the component receiving them)
* Can include any JavaScript value (strings, numbers, objects, arrays, functions)
